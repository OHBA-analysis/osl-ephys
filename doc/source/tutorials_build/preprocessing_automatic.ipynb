This means that we run the automatic IC labeling, and remove those components from the data directly - without saving any intermediate data. Thus, this doesn't allow for doing manual labeling later on, and \"unlabeling\" components as bad. In general, we recommend using ``apply: false``, and then adding a manual step after the automatic preprocessing pipeline, where ICs are manually labeled, and sequentially removed from the data. Note that any preprocessing steps that come after ICA (e.g., epoching) would then also come after this manual step. So in that case we we would run `run_proc_chain` with a `config` that includes all step up until the manual step. We would then do the manual step, after which we have another call to `run_proc_chain` with a different `config` that includes the remaining steps. We can of course use this iteratively if there's more than one manual processing stage.\n\n:note: we reduced the ``n_components`` in the ``ica_raw`` step to 20 to speed up processing.\n\n"

This will be the name of the subdirectory in which derivative data are stored, as well as the prefix of the individual files.\n- ``ftype``: The extension for the preprocessed fif file, i.e., coming after the subject identifier (default ``preproc-raw``)\n- ``outdir``: The generic output directory in which the subdirectories will be created. By default the preprocessed data is not saved. Add a path here if you wish to save it.\n- ``logsdir``: The directory for processing and error logs. By default these are not saved.\n- ``reportdir``: Directory (see gen_report)\n- ``ret_dataset``: Return the dataset or not (not doing this only makes sense if you're saving the data to disk) - see below\n- ``gen_report``: osl-ephys can generate a report with summary measures and figures of the preprocessed data. We will have a closer look at this later.\n- ``overwrite``: Whether or not the overwrite existing data\n- ``skip_save``: List of dataset keys to skip writing to disk. If None, we don't skip any keys.\n- ``extra_funcs``: In case osl-ephys and MNE-Python don't have the function that you want to use, you can define the function yourself and specify the function name here\n- ``random_seed`` Random seed to set. If 'auto', a random seed will be generated. Random seeds are set for both Python and NumPy.\n- ``verbose``: print osl-ephys info\n- ``mneverbose``:  print MNE-Python info\n\n\nThe ``dataset`` dictionary that is returned by ``run_proc_chain`` contains different items depending on the preprocessing pipeline. For example ``dataset[\"epochs\"]`` is only returned because we specified our pipeline to include creating epochs. If we're saving the data to disk (i.e., ``outdir`` is specified), every item in ``dataset`` is saved seperately. The filenames will look something like:\n\n- ``raw``: `sub-001_run-01_preproc_raw.fif`\n- ``events``: `sub-001_run-01_events.npy` - numpy's way of saving data (load with `numpy.load()`)\n- ``epochs``: `sub-001_run-01_epo.fif`\n- ``event_id``: `sub-001_run-01_event_id.yml` - YAML file\n- ``ica``: `sub-001_run-01_ica.fif`\n\n\n## Adding custom functions to the pipeline\nosl-ephys has wrappers over most preprocessing functions from MNE-Python, plus a number of extra osl-ephys functions. However, you might want to use an algorithm that is not defined in either, for example from a third party toolbox, or a custom written function. You can easily create a wrapper such that you can use the function in the osl-ephys config. Just make sure that the function takes in the ``dataset`` as a first argument, and also returns the ``dataset```. You function should manipulate any of the keys in ``dataset``, and optionally, return a new key. New keys are :\n\n"

If a researcher asks you how the quality of the data is, the question is not trivial. With the report, we hope to give you a tool that quantifies some important metrics. It is not exhaustive, so if there's missing anything, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/osl-ephys/issues). \n\n\nNow open the report (you find it in your report directory).

Filenames, data size, and how many channels and events are in the data.\n- Time Series: Reports how much of the data was annotated as bad segments. Then shows the variance for each channel type (bad segments are highlighted in red), including and excluding outliers. Below you will see the raw data from the EOG and ECG channels.\n- Channels: Shows a histogram of the per sensor variance including and excluding outliers. Below it lists which sensors are labeled as \"bad\" (also annotated in red)\n- Power Spectra: The power spectrum seperately for each channel type; full spectrum (left) and zoomed in (right). Each line is a sensor.\n- Digitisation: Shows the Polhemus and HPI information.\n- ICA: For each component labeled as \"bad\", it shows the topography for each sensor type (top left), the power spectrum (bottom left), the ERP (top right - no ERP in our case because ICA was applied before epoching), and the variance (bottom right).\n- Logs: a detailed log of all the processing applied to the dataset.\n\n"
