Let's break it down.\n\n - The ``'Mean'`` spectrum corresponds to our constant regressor (though this actually computes an intercept as we've included other non-zero regressors in the model - see theory and simulation tutorial for more details). this contains the familiar 1/f-type power spectrum shape with a prominant alpha and beta peak around 10 and 15Hz respectively.\n\n - The ``'Linear'`` regressor has a sharp negative deflection around 9Hz which appears centered around occipital cortex. This suggests that occipital alpha power is decreasing over time during the data recording.\n\n - The ``'EOG'`` confound regressor has largest values at low frequencies around bilateral frontal sensors close to the eyes. Though we have done ICA cleaning on this data, we can see that some residual variabilty in low frequencies can still be associated with eye movements.\n\n - The ``'BadSegs'`` regressor also has its largest values around low frequencies but has a less structured topography than the EOGs.\n\nThe GLM-Spectrum has quantified all these effects in one shot across all sensors and all frequencies. Critically, this is a multiple regression so the parameter esimates for each regressor are partialled from the other regressors and only quantify the unique contribution of that regressor in describing the data.\n\nWe can explore the relationship between our regressors by exploring the 'efficiency' of the design matrix.\n\n\n"

        "The three subplots of the design efficiency show\n\n- **The correlation matrix** of the model regressors (with the constant term blanked out as it has no variance). There is some feint structure here but no large correlations.\n\n- **The Singular-Value spectrum** of the design matrix (Singular-values are computed by the singular value decomposition and are conceptually similar to eigenvalues in PCA). The profile of singular values indicates how close our design is to being 'low-rank'. A perfectly orthogonal and efficient design will have a flat set of singular values all around 1, where as a low-rank model will have some singular values very close or equal to zero. A low-rank model indicates that certain combinations of the regression parameters will be hard to estimate.  While the statistics we use will account for this by inflating the relevant variances, it is good to be aware when this is happening. For example, this could help stop us from being misled by the results of any affected statistical tests, and in some cases may help motivate a change in the design.\n\n- **The Variance-Inflation Factor** describes the extent to which each regressor can be predicted by the other regressors in the model. Typically, values above 5 (or sometimes 2 if you're being cautious) are taken as an indiction that a regressor might be co-linear with something else in the design matrix.\n\nTogether these factors indicate how 'efficient' our design is - in other words, how well we're going to be able to estimate the parameters of the model. The singular-value spectrum indicates this most closely. If this contains any zeros then there is no matrix inverse of our design, which means our parameter estimates will be 'minimum-norm' estimates. This can be ok, in some cases we might accept inflated variance around our estimates if there is good reason to keep the design matrix as it is. In other case, this is an indication to changes something in the design.\n\nIf you do want to change the design, the correlation matrix and VIF scores indicate where any co-linearity in the model is likely to be. If there are large correlations and VIF values for a particular set of regressors, you may want to consider merging them or removing some of them.\n\nIn this case, we have a pretty well formed design matrix and are happy to continue!\n\n\nSo far, we've only looked at the point estimates of our GLM-Spectra - but we will often want to view the spectrum of t-values for each contrast as well. This accounts for the standard error around the estimate of each parameter. If we have a large parameter estimate that also has a large uncertainty around its value, then this will be reflected in its low t-statistic. In contrast, we may have a small parameter estimate that the model is confident about - this will have a high t-statistic even though the parameter estimate is small.\n\nLet's take a look at the t-value spectra for our four contrasts.\n\n"

This is as mean and intercept terms of spectrum estimates will have all positive values. The t-test quantifing whether the point estimate is different form zero is then not very informative..\n\nMuch of the structure in the other three regressors has also flattened a bit. In particular, the large alpha effect in the 'Linear' regressor has pretty much gone - indicating that this estimate had a large standard error.\n\nThe strong frontal effect the low-frequencies of the EOG regressor remains, indicating that this effect is very strong.\n\n## Group analysis - combining multiple datasets\n\nIt is rarely the case that we want to study a single data recording. Though this can be interesting in and of itself, we typically want to combine results across multiple (or many!) recordings to try and identify if there are consistent effects that might generalise to a wider population.\n\nA group analysis serves this purpose. In the context of General Linear Modelling, a group analysis takes in the results from 'first-level' analyses of single datasets and combines them with a 'second-level' or 'group-level' analysis. In the case of our GLM-Spectra, our second level dataset is the set of parameter estimates fitted across all individual recordngs. We describe variability across partcipants in this group dataset with a group design matrix to provide a final set of results.\n\nAs a example - let's say we fit first-level models with 4 regressors across 100 frequencies and 306 sensors. The copes for each first-level result would be a matrix of shape ``(4, 100, 306)``. If our second level analysis combines results across 48 particpants, the first level results would be combined into a group-dataset of shape ``(48, 4, 100, 306)``. A group design matrix might then contain 2 regressors describing between subject variability. So, the final fitted model will be a matrix of shape `(2, 4, 100, 306)` containing (2 group contrasts, 4 first level contrasts, 100 frequencies, 306 sensors).\n\nAs the second level is still just a GLM, the same principles about varability and t-statistics that we saw in the previous section still apply to group analyses.\n\nLet's run a group analysis to illustrate these principles. We start by finding the our datafiles on disk. These files contain first-level GLM-Spectra that have already been fitted for you.\n\n"

        "The t-values here are much smaller but there is some structure. Perhaps the area around alpha in the change over runs of the mean spectrum shows an effect.\n\nTo formally assess an effect we need more than the t-value. It may have been the case that we were just lucky to observe a given effect with our data - but how can we quantify whether an effect was likely to have occured by chance?\n\nWe assess this using non-parametric permutation statistics. This is a numerical method for quantifying how often a particular result could have occured according to a particular null hypothesis. This is a pragmatic approach which simulates models that remove structure in the design matrix in accordance with the null hypothesis. We can compute hundreds or thousands of these null models and place their statistical estimates into a 'null' distrbution. Our observed statistic can then be compared to this null to create an estimate of how likely our result could have happened by chance.\n\nLet's take the group mean of the EOG effect as a specific example. Our null hypthesis is that the GLM-Spectra of the EOG effect is no different from zero. If this were true, we would expect the parameter estimates of the model to be randomly distributed around zero. In turn, if this is true - then flipping the sign of half our first-level parameter estimates will not change the group result.\n\nSo, to assess this, we'll compute a few hundred 'null' models in which we flip the sign of the group-level mean regressor. If the real group mean is not different from zero then its value should fall well within this null distribution. If our real result would be very unlikely to have occurred by chances, then it should fall on the tails of the null distribution.\n\nHere, we show an example permuted design matrix for a single 'null' model.\n\n"
