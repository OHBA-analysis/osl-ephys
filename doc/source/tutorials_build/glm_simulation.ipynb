        "\n# Frequency Spectrum Estimation - Simulations & General Linear Models\n\nFrequency-domain analyses of oscillations in electrophysiological recordings of brain activity contain information about rhythms in the underlying neuronal activity. Many aspects of these rhythms are of interest to neuroscientists studying EEG and MEG time series. Many advanced methods for spectrum estimation have been developed in recent years, but the core approach has been the same for many years.\n\nThis tutorial will introduce the concept of power spectrum estimation using the standard approach in electrophysiology: Welch's Periodogram. We will describe this approach with simulations and explore a recent update that merges Welch's method with a General Linear Model to define a GLM-Spectrum.\n\n\n## Getting started\n\nWe start with some preparation, let's import ``numpy``, ``scipy.signal`` and ``osl_ephys`` for analysis and matplotlib for some visulistions.\n"

        "## Spectrum Estimation\n\nA frequency spectrum is a description of how the variance in a time domain signal can be distributed across a range of frequencies. This is a core analysis approach across science and engineering. The underlying mathematics is built upon the Fourier transform which is one of the fundamental algorithms in signal processing.\n\nThe Fourier transform can then be used to compute a frequency spectrum to describe the signal. The profile of the frequency spectrum describes how energy in the time-domain signal is distrbuted across frequency. \n\nA huge number of resources provide an introductory of power spectra and the Fourier transform. Here are a few for wider reading (after the workshop!)\n\n - [Fourier Transform Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform)\n - [Spectral Density Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density)\n - [But what is the Fourier Transform? A visual introduction. (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY)\n - [Welch's method for smooth spectral decomposition (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK1F0-3VvQI)\n\n\nIn EEG and MEG analysis, we're typically intrested in using these methods to identify and describe any oscillations that might be present in a time-series. This is performed by many papers in many different analysis but the main computation of the spectrum itself tends to be computed in a consistent way - Welch's Periodogram.\n\nLet's take a look at this standard approach using a simulated signal. \n\nWe define a 10 second signal that is sampled at 128Hz. The signal will have one stationary (constant amplitude) oscillation at 10Hz and one oscillation with decreasing amplitude at 22Hz.\n\n\n"

        "As we'd expect - the longer window results in a higher frequency resolution and fewer windows. There is no right or wrong choice for window length as different analyses may want to emphasise one or the other depending on the hypothesis in question. this trade off between time resolution and frequency resolution just needs to be set to provide a useful representation of the data for the case in hand. We recommend trying a range of values to explore it's effect when first exploring a new dataset.\n\n\n## But what about those dynamics?\n\nWelch's method computes a single spectrum by taking the average across the time-windows. This feels appropriate for the 10Hz signal, but we can see that this may not represent the 22Hz signal well. The standard spectrum gives this peak the appearance of a single amplitude but this is actually the 'average' amplitude across a range of windows.\n\nThe GLM-Spectrum method replaces this simple average with a multiple regression model which provides way to quantify changes in the spectrum across the sliding window time segments.\n\nThe advantage of a GLM-Spectrum is that we can extend the model to describe more than just the mean term. This has a several advantages including some modelling of temporal dynamics and the abililty to accout for covariates and confounds when computing the spectrum.\n\nHere, we define a single covariate regressor describing a linear trend in time and fit GLM-Spectrum with a mean term and the linear trend covariate. We add the linear trend using the `reg_ztrans` keyword argument to `glm_spectrum` this specifies that we're adding a regressor and that we want the values in that regressor to be z-transformed prior to the regression.\n\n\n"

Data recordings aren't sine waves so they can only be so instructive for real data analysis.\n\nLet's modify out simulation to include some noise and, to be even more realistic, let's make somme high frequency noise that changes over time. We'll also compute a longer time series of 100 seconds, rather than just 10.\n\nWe compute our noise by computing the gradient (difference between adjacent time points) of some normally distribiuted white noise. The white noise will have a constant power spectrum across all frequencies. The gradient operation removes some of the slower drifts in the noise as it keeps only the difference between adjacent time-points and discards trends across many time points.

This can be a tricky concept, even for those who are already familiar with regression. Here we try to provide some insight by visualising the difference between a model with a single constant regressor, and a model with one constant regressor and one non-zero mean regressor.\n\nSo, let's dig into why this noise supression works.

In our model above, $m$ is the parametere from the 'Constant' regressor and $x$ is the parameter from the 'artefact' regressor.\n\nIn the GLM literature, this equation is often written in terms of $\\beta$ values and design matrices. In this form, our second model might look like this:\n\n$$ y = \\beta_0 \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} + \\beta_1 \\begin{bmatrix} x_{1} \\\\ x_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{m} \\end{bmatrix} $$\n\nThe critical difference is that all values to be estimated are consistently notated with $\\beta$ and the predictor values for all regressors are made explicit. Here, the intercept `c` is $\\beta_0$ and `x` is $\\beta_1$ and the two vectors are the two columns of our design matrix.\n\nIn the second model, the vector of predictors had been z-transformed to be zero-mean.
